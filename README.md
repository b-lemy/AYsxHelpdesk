## Available Commands

In the project directory, you can run:

### `git clone Change Directory to the Cloned Repo:"`,
<!-- 
The app is built using `create-react-app` so this command Runs the app in Development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. You also need to run the server file as well to completely run the app. The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console. -->

### `"cd django-helpdesk Create Virtual Environment:"`,

<!-- Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app will be ready to deploy! -->

### `"virtualenv hdenv Activate Environment:

Windows: hdenv\Scripts\activate Linux: source hdenv/bin/activate"`,

<!-- Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. -->

### `" Install Requirments:

pip install -r requirements.txt Run Migrations:"`,

### `python manage.py makemigrations python manage.py migrate Run Server:`

For running the server and app together I am using concurrently this helps a lot in the MERN application as it runs both the server (client and server) concurrently. So you can work on them both together.

### `"python manage.py runserver"`

<!-- For running the server file on you can use this command. -->
